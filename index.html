http://www.nba.com/. Is the place to go for all the the latest news. Sports games are updated in real time through JS which is amazing so i dont have to be behind on any news if im not able to watch games. I inspected the page and see alot of "DIV class=" this is probably due to all the boxes that they have and each one of those links leads to a different news story. I can also see that they have "hrefs" whcih are proabbly the things re routing us to where we need to go.
